= C++ example project manually scanned on SonarQube

It is very easy to manually analyze a C/C++/Objective-C project with SonarQube:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
.. Add a projectKey of your project
.. Add a Build Wrapper output directory
.. https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/[Generate a unique token] and set it as "sonar.login"
.. Set `sonar.host.url` to your SonarQube server URL
. Download and unzip the Build Wrapper for Windows from {SonarQube URL}/static/cpp/build-wrapper-win-x86.zip
. Add the Build Wrapper to your `%PATH%`
. Download and unzip the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/[SonarScanner] for Windows
. Add the bin directory of the SonarScanner to your `%PATH%`
. Wrap your clean build command with the Build Wrapper. E.g.: `build-wrapper-win-x86-64.exe --out-dir bw-output MSBuild.exe /t:Rebuild` (with `bw-output` being the same directory that the one set in `sonar-project.properties`)
. Run `sonar-scanner`

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] to see it in practice. Please be aware that the SonarQube server URL and the `sonar.login` are not completed in this example.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sc-sq-c-family-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
